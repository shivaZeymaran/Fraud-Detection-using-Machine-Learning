This project is based on a research paper titled "Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning" by Raghavan and El Gayar, which was published in December 2019.
The paper utilized various machine learning and deep learning techniques to tackle the issue of fraud detection across three different datasets.

For this project, we have implemented the machine learning methods discussed in the paper to deal with the problem of fraud detection, and we have also worked to improve the results in some cases.
